lion-there-client
=================

[AGH-UST] Simple client for the lion-there-server application written in CoffeeScript to replicate Put That There project from MIT.

We are replicating the project from MIT called Put That There using Kinect this time :)

The main part of the project is a server written in C# using Kinect SDK which communicates with the client using websockets.

lion-there-client is a sample app to present features of the server.
